How to execute

5) Create the schema and table in mysql database using the createTableInMySQL.txt file
6) Download the HttpClient from apache and include it in the java build path

I have used MySQL database as backend, Hibernate as ORM framework and Jersey framework for building the REST API

HttpClient is used for testing the REST API
